# Sorting_Algorithms
In this code, we have compared the working and speed of different sorting algorithms using graphical analysis.

Every sorting algorithm has a seprate code file and each of them is being called in the main.py file.
The files(file0.txt, file1.txt, file2.txt, file3.txt) contains the unsorted data, each file has different quatity of data so that performance of each algorithm can be compared on different set of data.
